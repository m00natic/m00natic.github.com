* Ahtung, Ahtung - a very customized environment may be in front of you!

Read on to see how to get started.

* [[http://colemak.com][Colemak]]

Firstly, colemak keyboard layout is used by default.  If this is
unsuitable, you can switch to other layouts with the <menu> button
(somewhere between right <alt> and <ctrl>).

* [[http://xmonad.org][XMonad]]

Secondly, the XMonad window manager is used.  Here's a brief
description of important keyboard shortcuts to get you going where Mod
corresponds to the left windows key and + is a composition of key
presses on "standard" (qwerty) keyboard layout:

|-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Key combination               | Action                                                                        |
| starting with Mod             |                                                                               |
|-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1...9                         | switch to respective virtual desktop from 1 to 9                              |
| <shift> + 1...9               | move current application window (surrounded by green edges)                   |
|                               | to respective virtual desktop from 1 to 9                                     |
| <space>                       | toggle layout for current virtual desktop                                     |
| <shift> + c                   | close current application window                                              |
| <Left Mouse Button>           | bring focus to the window under the mouse cursor                              |
| <Left Mouse Button> dragging  | move window under the mouse cursor (taking it out of tiling)                  |
| <Right Mouse Button> dragging | change size of the window under the mouse cursor (taking it out of tiling)    |
| t (g on qwerty)               | push current application window back to tiling                                |
| b                             | toggle taskbar visibility                                                     |
| u (u on qwerty)               | launch shell prompt to start a program by partial name                        |
| g (d on qwerty)               | launch a menu of currently opened application windows on all virtual desktops |
|                               | and choose one to visit by using arrows and <enter>                           |
| <shift> + <enter>             | launch XTerm                                                                  |
| k (e on qwerty)               | focus the next application window                                             |
| j (n on qwerty)               | focus the previous application window                                         |
| l (i on qwerty)               | grow master area (normally on the left)                                       |
| h                             | shrink master area                                                            |
| ,                             | increment number of windows in the master area                                |
| .                             | decrement number of windows in the master area                                |
| q                             | restart XMonad (you'd normally not want this)                                 |
| <shift> + q                   | quit XMonad (you'd rarely need this as either no WM will be used              |
|                               | or you'll quit X server as well)                                              |
|-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Note that if you change keyboard layout to us qwerty, you'll have to
use key in the parenthesis.

Lastly, GNU Emacs is actually my operating system and kitchen sink.
I'm also sort of minimalist, thus don't be surprised to see some
graphical (and not only) programs missing.
