#+TITLE: Why Emacs?

"Why, oh, why use an ancient 30 year old program nowadays?"

* When the whole is more than its parts

What's the point of using Emacs for everything - editing whatever
code, compiling, debugging, version control, mail and news, shell and
REPL, DB prompts, remote access, document reading and writing,
planning, chat, even browsing?  For each of those there would be some
specialised program that does similar or better things and even
friendlier to users.

- All-Emacs means more or less consistent interface.  No need to learn
  another specialised program with its specific set of idioms however
  simplified.

- Integration between different modules is much easier.  Making
  different programs even communicate would require tons of technical
  quirks if those programs were not intended for this.  And this is
  not in the hands of the users.
