* Emacs

[[./emacs/emacs-intro-bg.org][Въведение в Емакс]]

[[./emacs/emacs-wiki.org][Opinionated Emacs guide for newbies and beyond]], written for my
colleagues but being general and self-contained thus applicable to
broader public.

* Presentations

Introductions done for my coworkers.

[[./presentations/lisp.pdf][Lisp]]

[[./presentations/git.pdf][Git]]

[[./presentations/haskell.pdf][Haskell]]

[[https://github.com/m00natic/m00natic.github.com/tree/master/org/presentations][Here]] are the Org mode sources, minimally tweaked.

* Miscellaneous

[[./my-pc.org][If you happen to sit on my computer]] don't panic!

[[https://github.com/m00natic][Here]] I'm on github.  Considering that this site is a project there -
the circle is now complete.

[[./andrey-kotlarski-cv.pdf][My Curriculum Vitae]] kept on [[https://gitorious.org/~m00natic][Gitorious]] for a change.
